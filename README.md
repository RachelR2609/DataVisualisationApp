# DataVisualisationApp
This is an interactive application created as part of University project, to help visualize the population of the UK during 1991, 2001 and 2011.
This program has two main pages: a menue page and the main page containing the map of the UK with all the population information.
All interactions are through keyboard inputs. 
Interactive features include: zoom, pan and rotate the map, filter through data and switch between menue page and main page.
